# Brian Folt, PhD
# Wildlife Biology, Quantitative Population Ecology, and Decision Analysis

I am a population ecologist and wildlife biologist who is interested in supporting smart decisions about natural resource management. I combine field research, quantitative modeling skills, and a structured-decision making toolkit to understand system dynamics and guide wildlife management in a transparent and inclusive framework. I have a B.S. in [Biological Sciences from Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/biology) (2011), a Ph.D. in [Ecology from Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/biology/) (2017), and post-doctoral experience from the Alabama and Florida Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Units at [Auburn University](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Alabama) and the [University of Florida](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/coop/). 

I am now an ecologist for the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) at the [Fort Collins Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort), where I am currently building models to support management decisions for free-roaming horse populations in the western United States. 

On this site, you can learn about my [research](https://brianfolt.github.io/research) and [teaching](https://brianfolt.github.io/teaching) background, where I conduct [field research projects](https://brianfolt.github.io/fieldwork), and the resulting [publications](https://brianfolt.github.io/publications). Last, I hope to highlight various other [musings, philosophies, and life experiences](https://brianfolt.github.io/musings) with periodic blog posts.
