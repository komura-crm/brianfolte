# Research 

My research program explores the field of population ecology from fundamental and applied perspectives. I conduct fundamental research that involves developing and testing hypotheses about the way populations function, and then I conduct applied research that evaluates how management can maximize fundamental and societal values. In particular, I use decision analysis tools, such as structured decision making, to produce scientific products that support strong decisions in natural resource management. **Click on the headers** below  to learn more about areas of my research and see examples of research products. I also include links to more detailed descriptions on my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Folt) profile. Also, check out my [fieldwork](https://brianfolt.github.io/fieldwork) page for a map of study sites, pictures, and videos from the research projects in the field and lab.

In general, I am interested in understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence population growth and regulation of wild animal populations. For my dissertation, I tested and integrated hypotheses describing bottom-up (food resources), top-down (predators), and parallel (intraspecific interactions) population regulation of a model frog and lizard assemblage at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.

I also conduct research that has strong applications for wildlife management and conservation. I use field studies to understand the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing demographic vital rates of species, and then I build mathematical population models that evaluate how management plans influence population growth and population persistence. I use the process of optimization to evaluate how different management strategies achieve fundamental objectives (e.g., population viability) while minimizing limiting constraints (e.g., cost). In particular, I often study populations of imperiled vertebrates that are currently listed or being petitioned for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). This research seeks to support strong decision-making processes to conserve imperiled species while operating under real-world scenarios, such as limited budgets.

Habitat fragmentation in the Anthropocene has drastically reshaped natural landscapes and greatly disrupted patterns of gene flow among plant and animal populations, particularly for ‘rare’ species with low dispersal ability. However, when species decline and become at risk of extinction, populations become less abundant and typical methods to assess demographic features (e.g., mark-recapture) can become impractical for estimating trends in population vital rates. To this end, I use a molecular ecology toolkit to assess demography features for imperiled species, such as population redundancy (i.e., the number of populations), effective population size, genetic diversity, migration between populations, and phylogenetic structure – and I leverage this information to guide conservation strong decision making.
